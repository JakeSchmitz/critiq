Hey, thanks for checking out Critiq!

Right now we are in private beta testing, so if you want to create a drive to get feedback you'll need to get permission from us first. If you haven't already created an account, please do so at critiq.me/signin.

Once you've signed up, just send an email to creator@critiq.me and introduce us to a cool project you're working on that you think could use some critiques, and we'll get you set up with a creator account. 

That's about it, we hope you'll sign up, create a drive, and get some great feedback here at Critiq!
