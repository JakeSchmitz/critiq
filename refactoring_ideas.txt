open up active record base and create an has_activity method, use metaprogramming
create a social media class to thin out the auth controller

Things in need of refactoring: 
	all in javascript in erb files
	vote action in feature groups controller
	upvote and downvote in feature controller
	maybe create seed_data for dashboard visualization
