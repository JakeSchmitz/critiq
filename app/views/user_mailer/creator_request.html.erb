		<h4>Hey, thanks for checking out Critiq!</h4>

		<p>Right now we are in private beta testing, so if you want to create a drive to get feedback you'll need to get permission from us first. If you haven't already created an account, please do so here <%= link_to 'Sign Up', '/signin' %>.</p>

		<p>Once you've signed up, just send an email to <%= link_to 'creator@critiq.me', 'mailto:creator@critiq.me'%> and introduce us to a cool project you're working on that you think could use some critiques, and we'll get you set up with a creator account.</p> 

		<p>That's about it, we hope you'll sign up, create a drive, and get some great feedback here at Critiq!</p>
